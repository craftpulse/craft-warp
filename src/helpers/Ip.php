 * Ip coarsens a client address before it is stored, for installations that
 * enable the `anonymizeIp` setting. An IPv4 address has its final octet zeroed
 * (`203.0.113.45` becomes `203.0.113.0`); an IPv6 address keeps only its /48
 * routing prefix (`2001:db8:abcd:12::1` becomes `2001:db8:abcd::`) — the same
 * truncation widths the major analytics vendors use for IP anonymization.
 *
 * The result still places the address in a network coarse enough to cover many
 * households, so it no longer singles out one connection, while remaining
 * useful as a "roughly where" display value. Geo lookups are unaffected by
 * design: [[\craftpulse\warp\services\Geo::lookup()]] runs on the full address
 * first, and only the stored copy is anonymized.
